# Discussion: 

### Introduction:
Introduction to the Gitcoin Ambassadors program and quick intros from everyone on the call. Discussion of the goal of eventually having at least one Ambassador from every continent. 

### Overview of the program and responsibilities involved: 

Ryan began by discussing the general objectives of an Ambassador, including, but not limited to: promoting Gitcoin, assisting users through the platform, Github, Slack, and the new Discourse, and introducing users to new projects (Grants program, etc.). Essentially, under the umbrella of platform stewards, the Ambassadors are a face of the community.

Vivek continued by discussing the explicit responsibilties involved as an Ambassador: 
1. One of the things being split up as a core team right now is the job of going through the Issue Explorer and ensuring that each issue is faring well. Currently, a team of four goes through each of the issues (one person takes the open bounties, another takes the work started, etc.) weekly to get a feel for whats happening on the thread, and to intervene if necessary. One of the responsibilties that the Ambassadors could take over is exploring this issues and highlighting where intervention may be necessary, or where there may be QA/Bug's that need to be brought back to the core team for discussion. Approximately, 1.5-2hr commitment per person. 

### Next steps:
1. Invitation to slack channel. 
2. Invitation to Github organization for Ambassadors. 
3. Schwag dispersed ;). 
4. Kudos badge to be given out. 

### Other quick discussions: 
1. Discussion regarding issue explorer data being pushed to external sources. - [22:55]
2. Discussion regarding renewed Gitcoin landing page and how other projects were going to be split/affected. - [25:06]
3. Discussion about trust and if someone can lose Kudos. - [26:48]
4. Discussion regarding interconnectability of communication systems. - [37:26]
5. Discussion regarding escrow process in the case of a dispute. - [39:29]
