# Discussion: 

### Conversations:
1. Issue explorer check-in - Discussion regarding how issue-explorer check-in is going, with recommendations to (1) setup a set of template responses for issue types to make it convient for ambassadors to approach a situation (2) expand on the checkin tool with the possibility of hosting + attaching to back-end, so that checkin status is updated live across ambassadors' devices. 
2. Toronto meet-up - Discussion regarding potential meetup in downtown Toronto in February. Thinking 30-50 people, kickback signup, refreshments, 2-3hrs on a wed/thurs? Organized by Charles and Anish. Google doc shared in Slack.
3. Onboarding new ambassadors - Discussion regarding opening up Ambassador Wave 1 and finding new ambassadors who are interested in driving Gitcoin's mission.
4. Partnerships with other companies - Discussion regarding Gitcoin being open to partnering with other companies in the OSS/Sustainability/Crypto industry to host events/run workshops/etc. Potential to collab. with Bounties Network?

### Next steps:
1. Make issue-explorer check-in templates.
2. Figure out back-end for checkin website.
3. Find venue for Toronto meetup and discuss with Scott + team.
4. Open up applications for new ambassadors :tada:!
